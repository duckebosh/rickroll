# Rickroll quiz for friends!
## Rickroll your friends with this quiz!

[EXAMPLE SITE](https://teamquizmaker.netlify.app/)

I've put together this basic quiz in html (and tried to make it as realistic as possible) and here it is if you would like to rickroll your friends. When you click the 
'submit' button it will redirect to [This rickroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0&ab_channel=Duran). Feel free to share around but remember you need to host it.
You can also fork this and host through Github pages.
